## 📖 About the Project
Building a custom personal computer is a technical task that can be overwhelming for beginners. Choosing incompatible parts or mismanaging your budget leads to wasted time, money, and hardware performance bottlenecks. 

**ECPC (Efficient Custom Personal Computer Builder)** is a Java-based console application designed to help students, first-time PC builders, and hobbyists plan, validate, and optimize custom PC builds based on budget, intended workload (schoolwork, gaming, or video editing), and brand preferences.

---

## 🎯 Problem Being Addressed
* **Hardware Incompatibility:** Manually verifying sockets, RAM types, power draws, and case clearances is error-prone.
* **Budget Misallocation:** Users often overspend on unbalanced components (e.g., pairing an expensive GPU with a weak CPU).
* **Technical Complexity:** Beginners lack intuitive guidance when navigating complex hardware specifications.

## 🚀 Project Objectives

### General Objective
To develop a Java-based application that guides users in designing a compatible PC build within their budget by validating component compatibility and power requirements, rating the CPU-GPU balance, and recommending parts tailored to the user's workload.

### Specific Objectives
1. **Parts Catalog:** Load CPUs, motherboards, GPUs, RAM, storage, power supplies, and cases from a local data file with specifications, performance scores, and prices.
2. **Compatibility Validation:** Check CPU-motherboard sockets, RAM types/capacities, case form factors vs. GPU lengths, and PSU wattage safety margins.
3. **Auto-Build:** Automatically recommend a complete, compatible build within a specified minimum and maximum budget range.
4. **Bottleneck Detector:** Rate CPU-GPU balance as *Balanced*, *Moderate*, or *Severe* for the chosen workload.
5. **Custom Builds:** Allow users to create, edit, save, and load custom PC builds.
6. **Application of Object-Oriented Programming Principles:** Demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming principles to ensure extensibility for new component types.

## 👥 Target Users

| Target User | How They Will Use the System |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Students** | Enter a budget range and school/light-gaming workload to receive affordable, compatible part recommendations. |
| **First-Time PC Buyers** | Input preferences to generate optimized builds while receiving warnings against incompatibilities or performance mismatches. |
| **PC Hobbyists** | Input custom part lists through the Custom Build feature to check compatibility, power draw, and bottlenecks before saving. |

## ✨ Main Features

* 🔍 **Compatibility Checker:** Verifies socket types, dimensions, form factors, and power sufficiency.
* ⚖️ **Bottleneck Detector:** Compares CPU and GPU performance relative to the chosen workload to flag potential performance bottlenecks.
* ⚙️ **Auto Build and Budget Optimizer:** Generates optimal builds matching user budgets and brand preferences.
* 🛠️ **Custom Build:** Lets users add, replace, or remove specific parts for a build they have in mind, with the running total cost and compatibility status shown as they edit.
* 💾 **Save & Load Builds:** Persist and retrieve your custom configurations from local files.

## 🧱 OOP Concepts Demonstrated

## 🧩 9. OOP Concepts Demonstrated

* **Classes and Objects:** Defines blueprints for hardware and system logic (such as `Component`, `CPU`, `Motherboard`, `GPU`, `RAM`, `Storage`, `PowerSupply`, `PCCase`, `PCBuild`, and `PartCatalog`), with objects representing individual catalog parts, the user's current build, and generated reports.
* **Methods:** Encapsulates core operations including calculating total costs and estimated wattage (`PCBuild`), running compatibility checks (`CompatibilityChecker`), computing CPU-GPU balance (`BottleneckAnalyzer`), and generating recommended builds (`BuildRecommender`).
* **Encapsulation:** Keeps attributes like price, socket type, wattage, dimensions, and performance scores private and accessed via public getters, while catalog parts have no setters to prevent modification after loading and build updates pass through validating methods like `addComponent()`.
* **Inheritance:** Uses the abstract class `Component` to hold shared attributes (`ID`, `name`, `brand`, `price`), which `CPU`, `Motherboard`, `GPU`, `RAM`, `Storage`, `PowerSupply`, and `PCCase` extend to add their own specifications and avoid repeated code.
* **Polymorphism:** Handles all parts uniformly as `Component` objects (such as storing them in a single list and displaying them in a single loop) while each subclass overrides methods like `getSpecs()` and `checkCompatibility()` with specialized behavior.
* **Abstraction:** Relies on the abstract class `Component` to declare mandatory methods for every part, hiding complex calculations like wattage totals and bottleneck formulas behind simple method calls for the menu code.
* **Exception Handling:** Employs custom exceptions (such as `IncompatibleComponentException`, `BudgetExceededException`, and `InvalidInputException`) alongside try-catch blocks to handle invalid inputs, incompatible parts, unfeasible budgets, and missing or corrupted files without crashing the program.
* **Arrays/Data Handling:** Utilizes `ArrayList` collections to store the parts catalog, the components in the active build, and the collection of saved builds.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations
* **No Live Pricing/Checkout:** Prices and specifications are derived from a static local dataset.
* **Estimated Benchmarks:** Performance scores and bottleneck ratings rely on fixed reference scores rather than real-time hardware diagnostics.
* **Standard Desktop Parts Only:** Specialized server hardware, laptops, pre-builts, custom liquid cooling loops, and individual CPU coolers/case fans are excluded.
* **Local Storage Only:** No user accounts or cloud storage features; all saved builds reside in local files.
